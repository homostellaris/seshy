# What is Seshy?
Having too many tabs open is bad for your productivity because you waste time looking for the tab you need.

Rather than having one Chrome window with lots of tabs its best to have many Chrome windows with only a few tabs. Each Chrome window can represent one task that you are working on and have only the tabs needed for that task. We could call these focused Chrome windows *sessions*!

Whilst you are working it should be effortless to create, name, and switch between sessions. It should also be easy to close sessions you are no longer working on and re-open them later. This is what **Seshy** does! Watch the video below to see it in action ðŸ‘‡

# How does Seshy work?
At its core Seshy maps *windows* to *bookmark folders* and *tabs* to *bookmarks*. Being able to store *sessions* as bookmark folders and bookmarks allows them to be closed and re-opened later and also means they sync to your other devices (assuming you have Chrome installed and bookmarks sync enabled).

# Contributing
There are plenty of oustanding issues for new features and improvements, feel free to raise a PR against an existing issue or create a new one but note that it is encouraged to use *discussions* for new feature ideas rather than *issues*.
